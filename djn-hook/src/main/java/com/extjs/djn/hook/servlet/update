+++ If we want to manage RegistryConfigurator by IOC we are obliged to give the class name in the servlet.

+ The Registry can't be managed by IOC. (No real need found actualy) but I think it could simplify to expose it in the servlet
+ The Scanner can't be managed by IOC. (No real need found actualy)


++ It could be great to split everything done in createDirectJNgineRouter. This method can't be  overrrided without rewrite all th stuff. For instance no acces to uploader and processor exist.

++ I this way the init(..) method have no real interest. The split a mention before cold be done here by calling multiple method for each part of the initialization. 

++ Allow execution of code before init could be interesting. Addind some pre-treatment.
  
    @Override
    public void init(ServletConfig configuration) throws ServletException {
	doBeforeInit(configuration);
	super.init(configuration);
    }

    protected void doBeforeInit(ServletConfig configuration) throws ServletException {
    }
    
++ In request you give the configuration in every method why don't get the configuration from getServletConfig() . The configuration must only be givent to init(ServletConfig configuration);
