In DirectJNgineServlet

need : mandatory
issue : If I want to use custom registry with IOC I need to give a valid class name to the servlet config.
reason : if condition line 150
change : moving all custom registry thing in one method
         protected void performCustomRegistryConfiguration(Registry registry)
         I don't give configuration as parameter because I can have it by using getServletConfig

need : nice to have
issue : I can access the servlet config before the HttpServlet initialization and before the begining of the router initialization.
reason : init implementation
change : add method
		 void doBeforeServletInit(ServletConfig configuration);
